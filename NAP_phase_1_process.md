Research Question Worksheet
Research Question Analysis / Results [ single PDF / total spreadsheet ] 

<strong><h2>Prototype</strong></h2>
General Overview
Building an interactive, web-based prototype (iterate / user testing)
Website: Wordpress microsite, using Divi theme with custom CSS 
Data Maps: built in Esri ArcGIS Online, iterating on symbology and data groupings in Web Map and Web AppBuilder.
Design Meeting/Presentation to Senior Staff to gather input and ideation for implementation and further development

Highlight: UX in Esri Products
Data layer density: How to differentiate between so many layers of data. Signal vs. noise.
Debugging: Web AppBuilder glitches (saving and linking to Web Map)

Share the prototype with partners and user focus groups (government, school admin, educators, family, community members) for feedback.
Share results and discuss value of design and data sharing in edu. policy & research
Communicate taxonomy with related partners and stakeholders
