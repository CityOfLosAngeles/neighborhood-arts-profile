<strong><h1>NAP Phase I Process</strong></h1>

<strong><h2>Discovery</strong></h2>
<strong>General Overview</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gather Data - exploration of existing indicators from existing projects; identification of useful data resources; pinpoint youth focused data</li>
  <li>Gather Project Interest from Stakeholders</li>
  <li>Explore Data-Sharing Partnerships</li>
  <li>Research Comparable Projects (List in Project Charter)</li>
  <li>Design Meeting Planning</li>
  </ul>

<strong>Highlight: Arts Datathon</strong>
<br>Over 150 participants, speakers, volunteers, and observers attended the Arts Datathon, which brought together artists, arts adminstrators, educators, students, community advocates, researchers, and professionals in culture. 33 unique arts-related datasets were cleaned, tagged, and compiled. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iKZGpPeeWfqPgJTZFGuKmD9a1Rx2z7Kc" target="_blank">[ Datathon Organizing Toolkit ]</a>

<strong><h2>Prototype</strong></h2>
General Overview
Building an interactive, web-based prototype (iterate / user testing)
Website: Wordpress microsite, using Divi theme with custom CSS 
Data Maps: built in Esri ArcGIS Online, iterating on symbology and data groupings in Web Map and Web AppBuilder.
Design Meeting/Presentation to Senior Staff to gather input and ideation for implementation and further development

Highlight: UX in Esri Products
Data layer density: How to differentiate between so many layers of data. Signal vs. noise.
Debugging: Web AppBuilder glitches (saving and linking to Web Map)

<strong><h2>Share</strong></h2>
General Overview
Share the prototype with partners and user focus groups (government, school admin, educators, family, community members) for feedback.
Share results and discuss value of design and data sharing in edu. policy & research
Communicate taxonomy with related partners and stakeholders
Include in DCA Newsletter / Social Media Campaign

Highlight: Meeting with Stakeholders
City Stakeholders: Mayor’s Economic Development Team, Planning Department, Chief Data Officer (Mayor’s Office)
Regional Stakeholders: LAUSD, LACAC, CCF (California Community Foundation, LA Counts)
