## Neighborhood Arts Profile

This is a versioned repository of software and design associated with the Neighborhood Arts Profile (NAP), a project of the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA). 

The Neighborhood Arts Profile (NAP) is a data tool that identifies opportunities to improve arts and cultural services in the City of Los Angeles. This project is a part of the DCA’s effort in tracking cultural and socioeconomic indicators across all LA neighborhoods. This pursuit of neighborhood-level insights will inform DCA’s place-based strategy toward improving cultural life of neighborhoods throughout LA and building city-wide cultural vibrancy. NAP offers users an access and ability to interpret the complete and up-to-date datasets on arts and culture in each Los Angeles neighborhood. 

This repository was developed to document and share the process of producing NAP. Comprised of design notes, templates, and other design artifacts, this repository is meant to create a knowledge community amongst and beyond the project team.

Using GitHub, the NAP project team continues to track and document the development of this tool. Taking inspirations from The Andy Warhol Museum’s public repository of [digital strategy](https://github.com/thewarholmuseum/digital-strategy/), we adopted the open source practice from software development. Sharing the content, process, and framework of this data project can help further DCA's public mission of access and transparency.
